# Write Number in Expanded Form - Part 2
# This is version 2 of my 'Write Number in Exanded Form' Kata.

# You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

# expanded_form(1.24) # Should return '1 + 2/10 + 4/100'
# expanded_form(7.304) # Should return '7 + 3/10 + 4/1000'
# expanded_form(0.04) # Should return '4/100'
